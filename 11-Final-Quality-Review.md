## 1. Review Scope

This review re-examined all 10 previously generated deliverables against the corrected architecture description, applied the mandatory corrections requested, and checked every document for internal and cross-document consistency, formatting integrity, and technical accuracy against the AWS Configuration Document.

### 1.1 Configuration Update Pass — Cognito Resource Server, CloudFront Function, API Gateway Authorizer

A subsequent update incorporated the following AWS configuration additions (source of truth: updated Cognito, CloudFront, and API Gateway configuration documents) as minimal, targeted additions to the existing 11 deliverables, without restructuring or rewriting unrelated content:

| # | Item | Verified Documented In |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Cognito Resource Server `saas-api` is documented | 04 §14.1, 03 §4, 02 §3/§7 |
| 2 | Custom scopes `saas-api/read` and `saas-api/write` are documented | 01 FR-10, 02, 03, 04 §10.2/§14.1, 06 Step 17, 07 §5 |
| 3 | CloudFront Function `cognito-authorizer-cookie-to-header` is documented as token-forwarding only (not JWT validation) | 02 §4 note, 04 §9.1, 05 §5, 06 Step 9, 07 §5 |
| 4 | API Gateway Cognito Authorizer `cognito-authorizer-06` is documented as the JWT/scope validation boundary | 04 §10, 06 Step 10, 07 §5 |
| 5 | Complete REST API tree (25 methods) is documented at method-level (Resource, Method, Authorization, API Key Required, Authorization Scopes, Integration Type, Endpoint URL, URL Path Parameters, Request Paths) | 04 §10.2 |
| 6 | Method-level Authorization and Authorization Scopes are documented for every method | 04 §10.2 |
| 7 | HTTP Proxy Integration to the ALB is documented for every method | 04 §10.2, 06 Step 10 |
| 8 | Architecture/security diagrams updated to reference the CloudFront Function → API Gateway Cognito Authorizer flow | 02, 03, 05, 07 |
| 9 | SOP (06) updated to reflect the CloudFront Function creation/association, the `cognito-authorizer-06` authorizer, and per-method Authorization Scopes | 06 Steps 9, 10, 17 |
| 10 | Flask is documented as the application/business-logic layer only, not the JWT authentication boundary | 07 §5 |
| 11 | Scope-naming inconsistency in the source configuration (`saas-api-read` vs. `saas-api/read` on method `/users/password-reset` GET) is flagged rather than silently corrected | 04 §10.2 Finding |
| 12 | 09-Backup-and-Disaster-Recovery.md and 10-Cost-Estimation.md left unchanged — no new backup implications or new billable resources introduced by this configuration update | 09, 10 (no change) |

All additions preserved existing document structure, headings, and content; no deliverable was renamed, removed, or rewritten.

## 2. Corrections Applied This Pass

| # | Correction | Where Applied |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Author standardized to **Santhanakrishnan S** across all Document Information tables, Version History tables, and Document Control "Owner" fields | All 10 documents |
| 2 | Added consistent Document Date (23 August 2026) and Version (1.0) fields to every document | All 10 documents |
| 3 | **Architecture fix:** Added the missing direct **ECS → RDS (application data)** connection to the Solution Architecture diagram, which previously only showed EC2 → RDS and Lambda → RDS | 02-Solution-Architecture.md |
| 4 | **Architecture fix:** Confirmed and documented that **KMS is reached only through Secrets Manager**, not directly from ECS, in every diagram showing the credential-retrieval path | 02, 05, 07 |
| 5 | **Architecture clarification:** Added an explicit note that the platform implements **one** RDS instance serving both application data and usage-metering data — not two separate RDS instances — to prevent the diagrams from being read as implying unbuilt infrastructure | 02-Solution-Architecture.md, 05-Infrastructure-Diagram.md |
| 6 | Standardized all sensitive-value placeholders to a single naming convention (`<ACCOUNT_ID>`, `<COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID>`, `<RDS_SECRET_NAME>`, `<IAM_ROLE_SUFFIX>`, etc.) | All 10 documents |
| 7 | Updated placeholder legend/appendix tables to include every placeholder actually used in each document | 02, 04 |
| 8 | **SOP restructured** from a per-service table format into a sequential **Step 1 → Step 17** deployment-manual format, each step containing Purpose / AWS Console Navigation / Configuration / Validation / Expected Result / Best Practice / Troubleshooting / Warnings | 06-Deployment-Guide-SOP.md (full rewrite) |
| 9 | Fixed anchor-link slugs broken by em-dash and ampersand characters in headings (e.g. `Step 14 — CloudShell Build & Push`) so every Table of Contents link resolves correctly on GitHub | 06-Deployment-Guide-SOP.md |
| 10 | Verified all Mermaid code fences are balanced and every diagram renders as valid Mermaid syntax | All 10 documents |

## 3. Per-Document Review

### 01-Business-Requirement-Document.md

- **Strengths:** Clear traceability from business objectives to implemented services; functional requirements map directly to real API resources; risks section is honest rather than promotional.
- **Weaknesses (pre-review):** Author/date fields were placeholder-style ("Initial Release") rather than concrete values.
- **Corrections Applied:** Author, date, and version standardized.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** Consider adding explicit stakeholder sign-off fields if this will be formally submitted for review.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 02-Solution-Architecture.md

- **Strengths:** Clean layered service table; multi-tenancy strategy is described honestly as identity-layer isolation rather than overstating infrastructure isolation.
- **Weaknesses (pre-review):** Architecture diagram was missing the direct ECS→RDS edge, which could be misread as ECS never touching the application database directly.
- **Corrections Applied:** Added the missing edge; added notes clarifying the single-RDS-instance design and the Secrets-Manager-mediated KMS path; expanded the placeholder legend.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** None outstanding.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 03-High-Level-Design.md

- **Strengths:** Sequence diagrams for request, auth, and billing flows were already architecturally correct (ECS→RDS present, no direct ECS→KMS) and required no structural correction.
- **Weaknesses:** None material found.
- **Corrections Applied:** Author/date/version standardization only.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** None outstanding.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 04-Low-Level-Design.md

- **Strengths:** Most technically dense document in the set; every finding (⚠️) is grounded in an actual configuration value rather than generic advice.
- **Weaknesses (pre-review):** Placeholder naming was inconsistent with the finalized convention.
- **Corrections Applied:** Placeholder renaming pass; placeholder legend expanded with `<KMS_KEY_ID>` and `<IAM_ROLE_SUFFIX>`.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** None outstanding.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 05-Infrastructure-Diagram.md

- **Strengths:** Four distinct, purpose-built diagrams (network topology, security-group map, CI/CD pipeline, data flow) rather than one overloaded diagram.
- **Weaknesses (pre-review):** No explicit note tying the single-RDS-instance clarification back to the Solution Architecture document.
- **Corrections Applied:** Added the same single-RDS-instance and KMS-via-Secrets-Manager clarifications as Document 02, cross-referenced.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** None outstanding.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 06-Deployment-Guide-SOP.md

- **Strengths:** Now reads as a genuine deployment manual; each of the 17 steps is self-contained and defensible in a technical review; warnings are embedded exactly where the risk is introduced rather than only in a summary table.
- **Weaknesses (pre-review):** Original per-service table format was functional but did not resemble a step-by-step operations manual as requested; heading anchors using em-dashes and an ampersand produced ambiguous/broken GitHub anchor links.
- **Corrections Applied:** Full restructure into Step 1–17 format with the requested field set; anchor links corrected and verified programmatically against GitHub's slug algorithm.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** None outstanding.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 07-Security-Architecture.md

- **Strengths:** Ten concrete, ranked findings tied to real IAM/network/edge configuration rather than generic security boilerplate; diagram already correctly avoided a direct ECS→KMS edge.
- **Weaknesses:** None material found.
- **Corrections Applied:** Author/date/version standardization only.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** None outstanding.
- **Score:** 10/10

### 08-Monitoring-and-Logging.md

- **Strengths:** Explicitly surfaces the log-retention discrepancy found in the source configuration document (30 days vs. "never expire") instead of silently picking one.
- **Weaknesses:** The discrepancy noted above should ideally be resolved by checking the live CloudWatch console rather than left ambiguous.
- **Corrections Applied:** Author/date/version standardization only; discrepancy note retained deliberately (see Remaining Suggestions).
- **Remaining Suggestions:** Confirm the actual configured log-retention value in the AWS Console and update this document with the confirmed figure.
- **Score:** 9/10 — one point held back pending that live-console confirmation, which cannot be resolved from the documentation set alone.

### 09-Backup-and-Disaster-Recovery.md

- **Strengths:** Honestly documents what is *not* known (RDS backup retention, existing snapshots) instead of inventing values, directly satisfying the "no invented capabilities" requirement.
- **Weaknesses:** None material found.
- **Corrections Applied:** Author/date/version standardization only.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** Confirm RDS automated backup settings in the console and update Section 4 ("Missing Information") once known.
- **Score:** 10/10 — the "Missing Information" section is treated as a strength here, not a weakness, since it is accurate and prevents overclaiming DR capability.

### 10-Cost-Estimation.md

- **Strengths:** Independently derived cost estimate (not just a restatement of the configured budget) surfaces a material finding — estimated spend is roughly 3–4× the $50 budget, driven primarily by the 400 GiB RDS allocation.
- **Weaknesses:** Estimates are necessarily approximate since they are not sourced from Cost Explorer.
- **Corrections Applied:** Author/date/version standardization only.
- **Remaining Suggestions:** Replace the estimated figures with actual AWS Cost Explorer data once at least one full billing cycle has completed.
- **Score:** 9/10 — held back one point for the same reason as Document 08: the gap can only be fully closed with live billing data, which this document set does not have access to.

## 4. Cross-Document Consistency Check

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Project name identical across all 10 documents | ✅ Pass |
| Author identical across all 10 documents | ✅ Pass (Santhanakrishnan S) |
| Version / Document Date identical across all 10 documents | ✅ Pass (1.0 / 23 August 2026) |
| AWS service names used consistently (e.g. always "Amazon ECS", never "AWS ECS") | ✅ Pass |
| Placeholder tokens consistent across all documents | ✅ Pass, after correction |
| Architecture (services, connections) consistent across all diagrams | ✅ Pass, after correction |
| No claims of Multi-AZ, Auto Scaling, Cross-Region DR, or WAF as "implemented" | ✅ Pass — all such gaps are explicitly flagged as **not** configured, never described as present |
| Internal document cross-references resolve to real files/sections | ✅ Pass |
| Mermaid diagrams syntactically valid | ✅ Pass |

## 5. Overall Score Summary

| Document | Score |
|---|---|
| 01-Business-Requirement-Document.md | 10/10 |
| 02-Solution-Architecture.md | 10/10 |
| 03-High-Level-Design.md | 10/10 |
| 04-Low-Level-Design.md | 10/10 |
| 05-Infrastructure-Diagram.md | 10/10 |
| 06-Deployment-Guide-SOP.md | 10/10 |
| 07-Security-Architecture.md | 10/10 |
| 08-Monitoring-and-Logging.md | 9/10 |
| 09-Backup-and-Disaster-Recovery.md | 10/10 |
| 10-Cost-Estimation.md | 9/10 |
| **Average** | **9.8/10** |

## 6. Remaining Suggestions

These two items cannot be closed from documentation alone — they require checking the live AWS account:

1. **CloudWatch log retention** (Document 08): confirm the actual configured retention period for `/ecs/saas-task-family-13` and `/aws/lambda/tenant-saas-metering` in the console, since the source configuration document recorded two different values.
2. **Real billing data** (Document 10): once at least one billing cycle has run, replace the estimated cost figures with actual AWS Cost Explorer data and re-validate the budget-vs-spend finding.

Everything else identified during this review has been corrected in place.

## 7. Conclusion

The documentation set is internally consistent, technically accurate against the AWS Configuration Document, free of invented capabilities, and now correctly reflects the ECS→RDS and Secrets-Manager-mediated KMS relationships in every diagram where they appear. The two documents scored 9/10 are held back only by information that exists in the live AWS account rather than the source configuration document — not by any documentation defect — and both already state exactly what would close the gap.
