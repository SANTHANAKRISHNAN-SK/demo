## 1. Purpose

This document decomposes the platform into its major functional components and describes how they interact, without going into resource-level configuration (covered in the Low-Level Design).

## 2. Component Breakdown

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Network Layer** | VPC, public/private subnets, IGW, NAT Gateway, route tables, security groups |
| **Edge Layer** | CloudFront (CDN/HTTPS) + CloudFront Function (`cognito-authorizer-cookie-to-header`, token forwarding), API Gateway (REST API + Cognito JWT authorization and scope enforcement) |
| **Compute Layer** | ECS Fargate (application), EC2 (DB bootstrap), Lambda (billing) |
| **Data Layer** | RDS MySQL |
| **Identity Layer** | Amazon Cognito (User Pool, Hosted UI, User Groups, Resource Server `saas-api` with custom scopes `read`/`write`) |
| **Messaging Layer** | Amazon SQS |
| **Security Layer** | IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager |
| **Delivery Layer** | Amazon ECR, AWS CloudShell |
| **Observability Layer** | Amazon CloudWatch |
| **Cost Layer** | AWS Budgets |

## 3. Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Tenant User
    participant CF as CloudFront
    participant CFFN as CloudFront Function
    participant AG as API Gateway
    participant ALB as ALB
    participant ECS as ECS (Flask App)
    participant RDS as RDS MySQL

    U->>CF: HTTPS request (Cognito access-token cookie)
    CF->>CFFN: Viewer request
    CFFN->>CFFN: Convert cookie to Authorization: Bearer header
    CFFN->>AG: Forward to origin (API Gateway) with Authorization header
    AG->>AG: Validate Cognito JWT + required scope (cognito-authorizer-06)
    AG->>ALB: HTTP Proxy integration
    ALB->>ECS: Route to healthy task (port 8080)
    ECS->>RDS: Query / update tenant data
    RDS-->>ECS: Result set
    ECS-->>ALB: Response
    ALB-->>AG: Response
    AG-->>CF: Response
    CF-->>U: HTTPS response
```

## 4. Authentication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Tenant User
    participant COG as Cognito Hosted UI
    participant APP as Flask App (ECS)
    participant AG as API Gateway

    U->>COG: Navigate to /login/cognito
    COG->>U: Present Hosted UI login form
    U->>COG: Submit credentials
    COG-->>U: Redirect with authorization code
    U->>APP: /auth/callback?code=...
    APP->>COG: Exchange code for tokens (Authorization Code Grant)
    COG-->>APP: ID Token + Access Token (JWT, RS256, scopes saas-api/read + saas-api/write)
    APP-->>U: Authenticated session established
    U->>AG: Subsequent API calls (access token forwarded via CloudFront Function as Authorization: Bearer header)
    AG->>AG: Validate signature, issuer, expiry against JWKS, and required saas-api/* scope
```

The access token is scoped against the Cognito **Resource Server** `saas-api`, which defines two custom scopes — `read` and `write` — issued to the token as `saas-api/read` and `saas-api/write`. The authorization concept is:

```
Cognito Resource Server (saas-api)
        ↓
Custom Scopes (read, write)
        ↓
Access Token (saas-api/read, saas-api/write)
        ↓
API Gateway Cognito Authorizer (cognito-authorizer-06)
        ↓
Protected API resources
```

## 5. Billing / Usage-Metering Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant ECS as ECS (Flask App)
    participant SQS as SQS Queue (tenant-saas-usage)
    participant LAM as Lambda (tenant-saas-metering)
    participant SM as Secrets Manager
    participant RDS as RDS (tenant_usage table)

    ECS->>SQS: Publish usage event (tenant_id, action, api_path, status_code...)
    SQS->>LAM: Trigger with message batch
    LAM->>SM: Retrieve DB credentials
    SM-->>LAM: Encrypted credentials (via KMS)
    LAM->>RDS: INSERT usage record
    RDS-->>LAM: Acknowledge write
    LAM-->>SQS: Delete processed message / report batch failures
```

## 6. Component Interaction Table

| From | To | Protocol / Mechanism | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| CloudFront | CloudFront Function | Viewer request event | Convert Cognito access-token cookie to `Authorization: Bearer` header (token forwarding only) |
| CloudFront Function | API Gateway | HTTPS (origin) | Deliver app to end users with forwarded Authorization header |
| API Gateway | Cognito | JWT / JWKS validation + `saas-api/read`, `saas-api/write` scope check | Authorize API requests (`cognito-authorizer-06`) |
| API Gateway | ALB | HTTP Proxy Integration | Forward to application |
| ALB | ECS | HTTP (port 8080) | Route to container task |
| ECS | RDS | MySQL (port 3306) | Application data access |
| ECS | Secrets Manager | AWS SDK (`GetSecretValue`) | Retrieve DB credentials |
| ECS | SQS | AWS SDK (`SendMessage`) | Publish usage events |
| SQS | Lambda | Event source mapping | Trigger billing processing |
| Lambda | RDS | MySQL (`pymysql`) | Persist usage records |
| Lambda | Secrets Manager | AWS SDK | Retrieve DB credentials |
| EC2 | RDS | MySQL (port 3306) | Schema bootstrap / admin queries |
| ECS / Lambda / ALB / RDS | CloudWatch | Logs & Metrics API | Observability |

## 7. Notes and Best Practices

> **Best Practice:** Keeping JWT validation at the API Gateway layer (rather than inside the Flask app) centralizes authorization and reduces the attack surface reaching the application tier.

- The billing pipeline is intentionally **asynchronous** (SQS + Lambda) so that usage-tracking never blocks or slows the user-facing request path.
- The EC2 instance is used purely as an administrative bootstrap host for the database and is not part of the live request path.

## 8. Conclusion

The high-level design confirms a clean separation between the synchronous user-facing request path and the asynchronous billing path, with identity validation enforced at the edge before traffic reaches internal compute.
